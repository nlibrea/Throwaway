# Throwaway GitHub Repository

This is just a place where I am learning about working with GitHub repositories.

A Markup file (.md) is a text file that uses Markup syntax to produce a document that others  can read online when they check out your repository.

I hope to learn the followin:

- How to make a repo
- How to publish a repositories using GitHub Desktop
- How to make commits to a repo

try out [Introduction to GitHub] (https://github.github.io/on-demand) to learn more
